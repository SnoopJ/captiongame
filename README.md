Provided with a set of images and some friends within a WebSocket's reach, you too can have a dank time.

### INSTALL/run

`git clone https://github.com/SnoopJeDi/captiongame.git`  
`npm install`  
`node server.js`  
Browse to the web server running on localhost && [hold onto your butts](http://butt.holdings)

If you want to support images from imgur, put your [API key](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) into the `imgurapikey` file:  
`echo yourAPIkey > imgurapikey`

If you'd like to open a specific instance of the game, browser to /play/GameID, and only players accessing this URL will be in your game!
